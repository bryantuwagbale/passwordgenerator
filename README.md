# Password Generator

### About this application
* I was able to get the button for the password generator working, but struggled getting the checkboxes and sliders working properly. Using a string of all the lowercase characters, uppercase characters, and symbols.

* It would also seem my css isn't connecting properly. I'm not sure why it doesn't work on github, but it works fine when I open it from my pc. I thought I used relative pathing to link it but I may have made a mistake there.
